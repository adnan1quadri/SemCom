Spectrum Sensing with Deep Learning to Identify RADAR, 5G and LTE signals

The implementation demonstrates how deep learning based semantic feature analysis of a spectrogram can be utilized to characterize spectrum occupancy of RADAR and communication signals.
To compile and run the code, following tools are required -
1. MATLAB R2024b
2. Deep Learning Toolbox
3. Computer Vision Toolbox
4. Phased Array Systems Toolbox
5. LTE Toolbox
6. 5G Toolbox
7. DL Toolbox Model for ResNet-50
